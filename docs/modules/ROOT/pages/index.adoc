{project_name} is a powerful tool that converts Modelica models to Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) using Dymola. It provides both a command-line interface and a Python API for seamless integration into your workflows.

== What is mo2fmu?

mo2fmu simplifies the process of converting Modelica simulation models into standardized FMU format, which can be used across different simulation platforms and tools that support the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard.

== Key Features

* *Command-Line Interface*: Quick and easy conversion via terminal commands
* *Python API*: Programmatic access for automation and integration
* *Flexible Configuration*: Support for custom Dymola settings and FMI options
* *Multiple FMI Types*: Generate Co-Simulation (CS), Model Exchange (ME), or both
* *Package Management*: Load additional Modelica packages during conversion
* *Optimization*: Built-in compiler optimizations for better performance
* *64-bit Support*: Modern 64-bit FMU generation with code export
