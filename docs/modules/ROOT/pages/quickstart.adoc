:navtitle: Quickstart

Get up and running with {project_name} in minutes. This guide covers installation and your first FMU conversion.

== Prerequisites

Before installing mo2fmu, ensure you have:

* Python 3.8.1 or higher
* Dymola installation (version 2024 or later recommended)
* pip or uv package manager

== Installation

=== From PyPI (Recommended)

Install the latest stable release from PyPI using pip:

[source,bash]
----
pip install feelpp-mo2fmu
----

Or using uv (faster):

[source,bash]
----
uv pip install feelpp-mo2fmu
----

=== From Source

For development or to use the latest unreleased features:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/feelpp/mo2fmu.git
cd mo2fmu
uv venv .venv-mo2fmu
source .venv-mo2fmu/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv-mo2fmu\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
----

The `[all]` extra installs additional development dependencies including testing and linting tools.

== Configuration

=== Dymola Environment Variables

Configure Dymola paths using environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export DYMOLA_ROOT=/opt/dymola-2025xRefresh1-x86_64/
export DYMOLA_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/dymola
export DYMOLA_WHL=Modelica/Library/python_interface/dymola-2025.1-py3-none-any.whl
----

[TIP]
====
Add these to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` for persistent configuration.
====

For more configuration options, see xref:configuration.adoc[Configuration Guide].

== Quick Start: First FMU Conversion

=== 1. Create a Simple Modelica Model

Create a file named `SimpleModel.mo`:

[source,modelica]
----
model SimpleModel
  Real x(start=1);
equation
  der(x) = -x;
end SimpleModel;
----

=== 2. Convert to FMU

Using the command line:

[source,bash]
----
mo2fmu SimpleModel.mo ./output
----

This creates `SimpleModel.fmu` in the `./output` directory.

=== 3. Verify the Output

Check that the FMU was created:

[source,bash]
----
ls -lh output/SimpleModel.fmu
----

You should see your generated FMU file!

== Next Steps

* Learn about xref:usage-cli.adoc[command-line options]
* Explore the xref:usage-python.adoc[Python API]
* Check out xref:examples.adoc[more examples]
* Read about xref:configuration.adoc[advanced configuration]

== Using DevContainers in Visual Studio Code

For a consistent development environment, you can use DevContainers:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please ensure that you have https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] and https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker] installed before proceeding.
====

=== Getting Started

To start using DevContainers in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

. Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
. A `devcontainer.json` file in the root of your project in `.devcontainer` directory
. A configuration similar to the following one is available:
+
[source,json]
----
{
	"name": "Feel++ Dev Jammy",
	"image": "ghcr.io/feelpp/feelpp-dev:jammy",
	"extensions": [
		"ms-vscode.cpptools",
		"ms-vscode.cmake-tools",
		"josetr.cmake-language-support-vscode",
		"asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode",
		"ms-python.python",
		"ms-toolsai.jupyter"
	]
}
----

. Customize the configuration based on your project requirements.
In the example above, the configuration sets the name of the Dev Container as "Feel++ Dev Jammy" and specifies the Docker image to use as "ghcr.io/feelpp/feelpp-dev:jammy".
Additionally, it includes a list of extensions to install inside the Dev Container.

=== Opening in DevContainer

To open your project using the DevContainer, follow these steps:

. Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
. Search for and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container".
. Visual Studio Code will build the Docker image specified in the `devcontainer.json` file and open a new window inside the Dev Container.
. Once the Dev Container is loaded, you can start working on your project within the containerized environment.

=== Benefits of Using DevContainers

Using DevContainers in Visual Studio Code offers several benefits:

- **Consistent Development Environment**: DevContainers provide a consistent and reproducible development environment across different machines, ensuring that everyone works in the same environment.
- **Isolation and Dependency Management**: DevContainers isolate your project dependencies from your local machine, reducing conflicts and simplifying dependency management.
- **Easy Extension Installation**: DevContainers automatically install the specified extensions, making it easy to set up the required tools and configurations for your project.

NOTE: Make sure your Docker daemon is running and accessible from the terminal to use DevContainers in Visual Studio Code.
