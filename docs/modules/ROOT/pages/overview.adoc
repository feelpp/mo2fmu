== What is mo2fmu?

{project_name} is a Python package that converts Modelica models (`.mo` files) into Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs) using Dymola. FMUs are standardized simulation components that can be used across different simulation platforms supporting the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard.

== Why Use mo2fmu?

* *Standardization*: Create FMUs that work with any FMI-compliant tool
* *Automation*: Automate FMU generation in your CI/CD pipelines
* *Flexibility*: Customize FMU generation with various options and flags
* *Integration*: Easy integration with Python workflows and scripts
* *Performance*: Generate optimized 64-bit FMUs with code export enabled

== How It Works

mo2fmu acts as a wrapper around Dymola's FMU translation capabilities, providing:

1. *Python Interface*: A clean Python API for programmatic access
2. *Command-Line Tool*: Quick conversion via terminal commands
3. *Configuration Management*: Environment-based configuration for Dymola paths
4. *Headless Operation*: Uses virtual framebuffer (Xvfb) for headless Dymola execution
5. *Error Handling*: Comprehensive error reporting and logging

== FMI Standard Support

mo2fmu supports the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) standard:

* *FMI Versions*: FMI 2.0 (default)
* *FMI Types*:
** **CS** (Co-Simulation): FMU acts as black box with solver
** **ME** (Model Exchange): FMU provides equations, external solver needed
** **all**: Both CS and ME in one FMU
** **csSolver**: Co-Simulation with specific solver configuration

== Technical Features

=== Optimization Settings

mo2fmu automatically configures Dymola for optimal FMU generation:

* *64-bit Only*: Forces 64-bit compilation (`Advanced.CompileWith64=2`)
* *Code Export*: Enables license-free execution (`Advanced.EnableCodeExport=true`)
* *Optimizations*: Full compiler optimizations (`Advanced.Define.GlobalOptimizations=2`)

=== Dependencies

mo2fmu requires:

* Python 3.8.1 or higher
* Dymola installation with Python interface
* System dependencies:
** `xvfbwrapper`: Virtual framebuffer for headless operation
** `click`: Command-line interface
** `spdlog`: Logging functionality
** `pathlib`: Path manipulation

== Use Cases

* *Model Export*: Convert Modelica models for use in other simulation tools
* *CI/CD Integration*: Automate FMU generation in build pipelines
* *Model Distribution*: Package models for distribution without sharing source
* *Multi-Platform Simulation*: Create FMUs that work across different platforms
* *Co-Simulation*: Enable coupling of models from different domains
